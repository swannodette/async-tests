# async-test

A series of ClojureScript experiments with core.async.

## Usage

Clone the [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) to a
convenient location. `cd` into the repo and run `lein install`.

Then clone this repo into a convenient location and `cd` into it.

You can now build all of the examples from the project directory
with:

```
lein cljsbuild once NAME
```

You can see `project.clj` for the names of the different examples. All
of the example except `autocomplete` are run via `index.html` - just
open it in your browser.

For the `autocomplete` example open `autocomplete.html` in your
favorite browser after building it.
